// Guess what answers you would get if you ran this in the Javascript Console.
//Once you have an answer to the questions then check them by copying them and running it in the console yourself line by line 

//Evaluate the below:

3 + "65"   //"365"
7 - "3"   //undefined  X 4
15 % 5     // 0
5 % 15      // X 5
"Java" + "Script"  //"JavaScript"
"Java" - "Script"  //X NaN
" " + " "   //"  "
" " + 0   //" 0"
true + true  // true  X 2
true + false   //false  X 1
false + true   //true   X 1
3 - 4        //-1


//Evaluate the below comparisons:
4 >= 2  //true
6 === 2  //false
3 <= 1  //false
1 != 1   //false
"A" > "B"   //false
"B" < "C"   //true
"a" > "A" //true
"b" < "A"   //true X false  uppercase has lower values than lowercase
true === false  //false
true != true  //false


// Make the string: 
// "Go To Helsinki Business College," they said. "It'll Will Be "Fun"," they said.
// by using the + sign:


"\"Go To Helsinki Business College,\"" + " they said. " + "\"It Will be \"Fun\",\"" + " they said."
